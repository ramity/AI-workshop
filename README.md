# Lesson plan

### Lesson 1 - Docker

In this lesson, we explore Docker. An integral peice of software to this repo. With docker, fully configured containerized environments can be shared and used.

### Lesson 2 - Ollama

In this lesson, we deploy and use our own LLM.

### Lesson 3 - Transformers

In this lesson, we use the popular `transformers` library for python and explore some various models.

### Lesson 4 - Pytorch

In this lesson, we introduce `pytorch` and explain a typical machine learning workflow.

### Lesson 5 - Classification ML: Iris dataset

In this lesson, we take everything we've learned and we apply it to a classic example dataset: The Fisher's Iris dataset.

### Lesson 6 - Classification ML: MNIST

In this lesson, we step things up a notch and solve another classic but more difficult example dataset: The MNIST handwritten digits dataset.

### Lesson 7 - Retrospective: Thinking in N-space

In this lesson, we reflect on the problem space of the previous lesson.

### Lesson 8 - Classification ML: CIFAR-10

In this lesson, we step things up further, increasing the number of dimensions and solving a more modern dataset: The CIFAR-10 dataset.

### Lesson 9 - Regression ML: Boston Housing Prices

In this lesson, we pivot to a new type of problem and explore regression predictive modeling through the use of a boston house prices dataset. 

### Lesson 10 - Regression ML: Bike Sharing Dataset

In this lesson, we add in the dimension of time and explore predictive modeling of bike rentals given factors like temperature, weather, and time.

### Lesson 11 - Clustering: Wine Dataset

In this lesson, we group wines into categories based on chemical properties and explore K-means and hiercarchical clustering.

### Lesson 12 - NLP: Movie review sentiment

In this lesson, we perform sentiment analysis on an IMDB dataset to predict weather movie reviews are positive or negative.
